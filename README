# PROMPT

## What:

A way to request information from the user while a node.js script is running, on the command line, without invoking a REPL. Many languages have something very simple for this sort of thing built-in--for instance, you may have something like this in an early BASIC-ish program:

    r = input( 'Give me a radius: ' );
    print( 'Your area is '+ pi*r**2  + '!');

To my surprise, node.js didn't have anything quite like this, though it had the tools (process.openStdin) to make something like it. So, with a lot of help, I did.

## Install:

    npm install prompt

## Usage:

There are two ways you can use this module:

### 1. Like it's 1995

The way most inspired by BASIC, etc. is only different in that it uses callbacks instead of synchronous assignment:

    var Prompt = require('prompt');
    Prompt('Give me a radius: ', function(r) {
        console.log('Your area is '+ pi*r*r  + '!');
    });

As you can see, this mirrors the BASIC style pretty well.

### 2. Like it's the 2000's

If, however, you want to ask more than one question and would like to avoid nested callbacks, this module also supports method chaining! For example:

    var Prompt = require('./prompt');

    Prompt()
        .ask('What is your name?', 'name')
        .tap(function (vars) {
            console.log('You said: ' + vars.name);
        })
        .ask('What is your quest?', 'quest')
        .tap(function (vars) {
            console.log('You said: ' + vars.quest);
        })
        .ask('What is your favorite color?', 'color')
        .tap(function (vars) {
            console.log('You said: ' + vars.color);
            console.log('Okay, you may pass!');
        })
        .end();

This variation is much more flexible, and is the recommended way to use Prompt.
